# WeDance — Work Board

**Last updated:** 2026-04-04 23:23
**Maintained by:** Coordinator (Logbook Keeper)

> This board is the single source of truth for work status. Backlog files define *what* needs doing; this board tracks *where* each item stands.

## Rules

- **One agent, one item.** No agent works on two items simultaneously.
- **Pull, don't push.** Agents pull from Ready when dispatched — delegators approve what moves to Ready.
- **WIP limit:** max 1 item per agent in "In Progress".
- **No file conflicts.** Never dispatch two agents to modify the same files. Split work by file/directory ownership.
- **Reference the board.** Every agent dispatch references a board item — no ad-hoc tasks that bypass the backlog.

## Critical Path

```
G-002 Select pilot festival
  └─► O-001 Build MVP + O-004 Set up analytics (can start in parallel once festival known)
        └─► O-002 Convert schedule (needs MVP + festival data)
              └─► O-003 Launch distribution (needs schedule live)
```

**Current bottleneck:** G-002 — no pilot festival selected. Everything downstream is blocked.
