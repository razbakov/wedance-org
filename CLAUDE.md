# WeDance — S3 Organization

## Framework

@/Users/razbakov/Projects/ikigai-team/CLAUDE.md

---

Dance community platform governed with Sociocracy 3.0. Two co-founders (Alex Razbakov, Kirill Korshikov) delegate operational domains to AI agents.

## Primary driver

Dance event information is scattered across Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, Instagram stories, and physical flyers. Dancers struggle to discover events; organizers waste effort promoting across scattered channels.

## Current strategy

Test Festival Schedule first at one pilot festival. Validate that dancers will use an interactive schedule instead of static images. See `00_Organization_Logbook/03_Strategy.md`.

- Review schedule: `03_Coordination/Review_and_Retrospective_Schedule.md`
- Agents: `.claude/agents/`

- Org Coach: use `/org-coach` when creating or reviewing drivers, requirements, domains, roles, policies, or any governance artifact. Install: `claude install-skill https://github.com/razbakov/skills/tree/main/skills/org-coach`
- Code repo: `~/Projects/wedance-2026/`

Active domains: Festival Experience. Dormant: Discovery, Marketplace.

## Agents

| Agent | Reports to | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Autopilot | Alex | Autonomous dispatch loop — dispatches agents for Linear `Todo` issues, reports to founders |
| Coordinator | Alex | Cross-agent status, blockers, dispatch recommendations |
| Product Lead | Alex | Specs, stories, backlog, experiment design |
| Engineer | Alex | Code, features, tests, PRs |
| Operations Manager | Alex | Schedule conversion, data, platform ops |
| Designer | Kirill | Wireframes, UI specs, design briefs |
| Partnership Manager | Kirill | Organizer research, outreach drafts, pipeline |
| Marketing Lead | Kirill | Social content, distribution, growth |
| Analyst | Partnership | Metrics, reports, pivot trigger detection |

## Policies

- **Policy 001** — AI agent boundaries: agents draft, humans send. No external comms, deploys, or spending without approval.
- **Policy 002** — Decision-making: operational (agent), tactical (delegator), strategic (partnership by consent).
- **Policy 003** — Data & privacy: GDPR, minimal collection, no selling.
- **Policy 004** — Collaboration: ask-for-help protocol, peer feedback, involve affected parties, breaking agreements, learning from work.

## Conventions

- Logbook is the source of truth for governance
- Backlog items are individual files in domain governance/operations backlog directories
- **Linear (project `WeDance`) is the single source of truth for work status.** `Todo` = approved by a founder; only founders move issues there. The markdown Work Board is retired and must not be used for status.
- Pull system: agents pull from Ready when dispatched. WIP limit: 1 item per agent. No two agents modify the same files.
- All agent work delivered via PRs to `~/Projects/wedance-2026/`
- Requirements separate purpose (driver + requirement) from intervention (experiments)
- Agents read CLAUDE.md first to find file paths — never hardcode paths
- Review dates are quarterly (next: 2026-07-04)
- Retrospectives run after each milestone or every 2-3 dispatch cycles — see review schedule
