# WeDance — Strategy

**Date:** 2026-04-04

## Purpose
**Driver:** See [01_Primary_Driver_and_Requirement.md](01_Primary_Driver_and_Requirement.md)
**Requirement:** A platform where dancers discover events from a single source and organizers reach their audience with visibility into impact.

## Intended Outcome(s)

- Validate that dancers will use an interactive festival schedule instead of static images
- Build the audience layer that all future products (meetup planner, analytics for organizers) depend on
- Determine whether adoption is dancer-driven (B2C) or organizer-driven (B2B)

## Strategy

**Test Festival Schedule first, at one real festival.**

Rationale: The entire platform depends on one assumption — dancers will use a digital interactive schedule. If that's false, nothing else matters. Festival Schedule is the cheapest experiment to validate the foundation because:

1. It directly addresses the primary driver (scattered event information)
2. It requires no critical mass — even one dancer gets value from a better schedule
3. It tests both B2B and B2C paths simultaneously: upload the schedule ourselves (B2C), measure dancer usage, then approach the organizer with data (B2B)

Once validated, layer on Meetup Planner features (social coordination: rides, rooms, meals, partner matching) to increase engagement and test willingness to pay.

**Sequence:**
1. Festival Schedule → validate discovery (current phase)
2. Meetup Planner → validate social coordination and monetization (next phase)

## Organizer Segmentation (Kirill, 2026-04-10)

Two distinct organizer types require different approaches:

**Type 1 — "We build our own digital ecosystem"**
These organizers have strong digital ownership. Cannot sell them "a page." Possible offerings:
- White-label layer
- Engagement add-on
- Embedded experience
- Audience activation around their own channels

**Type 2 — "Chaos, scattered info, everything manual"**
These organizers have no strong digital presence. Can sell directly and simply.

**Implication for pilot:** Start with Type 2 organizers who don't have a strong digital ownership ego. They have the clearest pain point (scattered info) and lowest resistance to adopting our schedule tool.

**Pitch approach:** Outcome-led, not feature-led. Never sell "a platform" — sell compression of complexity. Use tailored samples built from the organizer's own festival data instead of generic demos. See [Organizer Pitch Playbook v1.0](../01_Domains/Festival_Experience/Governance/Organizer_Pitch_Playbook_v1.md).

## Responsibilities

| Who | What |
|-----|------|
| Partnership Manager + Kirill | Research and select pilot festival (organizer relationship, timing, size) |
| Operations Manager | Convert the pilot festival's static schedule into structured data |
| Marketing Lead + Partnership Manager | Distribute the schedule link to the festival community and collect feedback |
| Analyst | Measure adoption metrics (opens, return visits, shares, organizer interest) |
| Partnership (Alex + Kirill) | Review metrics and decide pivot/persevere |

## Metrics and Monitoring

| Metric | How Measured | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Dancers who open the schedule | Page views / unique visitors | Per festival |
| Return visits | Returning users during festival | Per festival |
| Shares | Link shares tracked via UTM or referral | Per festival |
| Organizer interest | Inbound from organizer after seeing usage | Post-festival |
