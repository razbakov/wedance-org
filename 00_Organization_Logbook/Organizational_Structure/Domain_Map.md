### Communication channels:
- **Async (default):** Agents report via structured logs/messages. Founders review when available.
- **Sync (when needed):** Partnership weekly call. Ad-hoc calls for urgent escalations.
- **Agent-to-agent:** Agents coordinate directly on operational handoffs (e.g., Ops Manager → Analyst). No human approval needed for data handoffs within boundaries.
